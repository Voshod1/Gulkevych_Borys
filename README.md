Hello, this is my answer for Selenium task from my university. It's a test for https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/ website, that logs in, goes to the Job Titles page and there adds new title, modifies it and then deletes it.  
In the project I used C# programming language, Visual Studio 2019, nuget tests and Selenium.  
How to install:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. On the start window, select Clone a repository
3. Enter or type the repository location, and then select the Clone button.
4. You might be asked for your user sign-in information in the Git User Information dialog box. You can either add your information or edit the default information it provides.
5. Select Save to add the info to your global .gitconfig file. (Or, you can choose to do this later by selecting Cancel.)

How to launch
1. Open SeleniumTask.sln file by Visual Studio (not code). If it's already opened proceed next
2. On top panel View->Test Explorer
3. Click "Run all tests in view" or ctrl+r,v
